I have uploaded the game to onedrive and sent the link in the ms forms
This game only works on Windows computers and if you want to run the .py files you must install pygame
Run the file called "run_this_file_to_make_the_game_work.exe" if you see a blue screen
saying "windows stoped this app from running" click on more info and click on "run anyway".
Or if you have python Installed your computer open the file called "main_file" in any python IDE and run it from there but you will have to install pygame(a python graphics library) when you open the game you will see a blue screen and three buttons choose anyone ( I recommend easy)

The aim of the game is to collect thrash and co2, you are in the helicopter press A or D to move left or right
and space to drop a net, your net will float down on the thrash and catch it, after that a co2 atom will spawn in the sky you must use your mouse to catch it. I recommend using a keyboard and Mouse.

Easy mode : Thrash and Co2 spawn separately
Medium mode : Thrash and Co2 spawn together and and the speed with the thrash and co2 move is increased
Hard mode : Thrash and Co2 spawn together and the speed is increased even more, if you fail to collect the thrash and co2 10 points will be deducted

To see my code open any of the .py files in any IDE or notepad or webroser
